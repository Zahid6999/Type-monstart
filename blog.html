    <p class="fs-5">The difference between sessionStorage and localStorage is that localStorage data does not expire, whereas sessionStorage data is cleared when the page session ends. A unique page session gets created once a document is loaded in a browser tab. Page sessions are valid for only one tab at a time</p>

        <h2 class="text-center fw-bolder text-bg-light rounded-3">Global scope vs Block scope</h2>
        <p class="fs-5">Before ES6 (2015), JavaScript had only Global Scope and Function Scope.

            ES6 introduced two important new JavaScript keywords: let and const.
            
            These two keywords provide Block Scope in JavaScript.
            
            Variables declared inside a { } block cannot be accessed from outside the block 
        <br>
        <strong>The work done inside the second bracket is called blog scope.... </strong>
        And the work that is done outside the seconde bracket  is called Global scope..
