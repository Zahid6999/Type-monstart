    <p class="fs-5">The difference between sessionStorage and localStorage is that localStorage data does not expire, whereas sessionStorage data is cleared when the page session ends. A unique page session gets created once a document is loaded in a browser tab. Page sessions are valid for only one tab at a time</p>

        <h2 class="text-center fw-bolder text-bg-light rounded-3">Global scope vs Block scope</h2>
        <p class="fs-5">Before ES6 (2015), JavaScript had only Global Scope and Function Scope.

            ES6 introduced two important new JavaScript keywords: let and const.
            
            These two keywords provide Block Scope in JavaScript.
            
            Variables declared inside a { } block cannot be accessed from outside the block 
        <br>
        <strong>The work done inside the second bracket is called blog scope.... </strong>
        And the work that is done outside the seconde bracket  is called Global scope..

        <h2 class="text-center fw-bolder text-warning">How javascript event loop works?</h2>
        <p class="fs-5">The Event Loop has one simple job â€” to monitor the Call Stack and the Callback Queue. If the Call Stack is empty, the Event Loop will take the first event from the queue and will push it to the Call Stack, which effectively runs it. Such an iteration is called a tick in the Event Loop.</p>

    <h2 class="text-center fw-bolder text-bg-light rounded-3">How do we get Undefiend?</h2>
    <p class="fs-5">1. Only Function declaration is in undefiend. <br>
        2. Return undefined if nothing is returned from the Function. <br>
        3. passing function parameters  but no arguments is this undefiend. <br>
        4.An undefined variable or anything without a value will always return <br> "undefined" in JavaScript. This is not the same as null, despite the fact that both imply an empty state.
